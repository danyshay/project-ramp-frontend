Things left to do :
Well I have made all the function calls to the project base 

#Need to make the enroll and feedback custom post types 
#if the submission is done for a particular project need to check if the submission are complete for that
So for that I need to get all the submission and see if the submission is made for that,  I can made a custom route to do all the function calls 

#Also need to sort of the badges for each user, Have to create another section where a badge is assigned to a user


lets start with then enrollment. So for the enrollment lets create a new post type ccalled enrollment and put all the information there 
so basically 
i have to take the id of the project and the id of the user and get it sorted out. on that asspect
I need to get user ID from the login and then also project id.


So basically now I have got the enrollmenr sorted out
Now i have to get all the list of enrollment of the user.
When  I get the enrollment of the user I need to check with the project id of each of the projects.
